# 🧠 BioSync — Smart Government Services Recommendation Engine

AI-powered backend engine that prioritizes government services using multi-factor scoring (urgency, seasonality, importance, behavior) – built with FastAPI and Python

> Built as an independent project by **Ghadeer Sameer**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

BioSync is a backend recommendation engine that analyzes government services and identifies which actions users should prioritize first.

This system was built to solve a real problem:

> Citizens forget service renewals, face fines, and struggle to track dozens of government services.

BioSync fixes that by turning information into **actionable intelligence**.

---

## 🎯 What BioSync Does

✅ Calculates a priority score for each service  
✅ Explains why the service is important  
✅ Ranks services from urgent → low priority  
✅ Returns structured data to any frontend  
✅ Generates SMS-style alerts (mocked)

---

## 🧮 Recommendation Logic

BioSync uses a **rule-based AI scoring system**.

### Final score formula:

Final Score =  
(Urgency × 40%) +  
(Seasonality × 25%) +  
(Category Importance × 20%) +  
(User Activity × 15%)

---

## 📊 How Scores Are Computed

### 1️⃣ Urgency
Higher score for fewer days remaining.

### 2️⃣ Seasonality
Services in peak seasons (e.g., travel) receive additional weight.

### 3️⃣ Category Importance
Critical services (identity, travel) are ranked higher.

### 4️⃣ User Activity
Active users receive increased priority weighting.

## 🚦 Priority Levels

| Score Range | Priority |
|--------------|----------|
| 80–100 | 🔴 Critical |
| 65–79 | 🟡 High |
| 50–64 | 🟢 Medium |
| < 50 | ⚪ Low |
